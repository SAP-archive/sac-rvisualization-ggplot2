# SAP Analytics Cloud R Visualization

## Description
As a data scientist I put a lot of work in analyzing my data and creating the right model to predict the future. Time is often of the essence and depending on the target group the results also have to be visualized in different ways. Imagine having a very complex model and explaining your results to your manager or a business group on a regular basis. An easy and efficient solution is to create a dashboard that can even be connected to live data. Once set up, it saves us valuable time that we can rather spend for creating awesome models in R or Python. We can even keep our familiar R environment with the R Visualization feature in SAP Analytics Cloud. In addition, we can filter the plots created with the R Visualization tool in the SAC and we can even link plots created with the SAC Story Modus with our R visualizations. Hence, we can insert R visualizations to our story, interact with the R visualizations using the SAC controls and share them with other users. 

## Requirements
